# Human_Resource_Analytics
Evaluated the attributes behind the attrition rate in a company using a Human Resource dataset and provided corrective strategies

- Performed data pre-processing, data exploration and added attributes (Feature Engineering) based on the exploration results to improve the features of the dataset
- Performed Association Analysis using Apriori algorithm to uncover relationships between attributes
- Trained and implemented C5.0, CART and Random Forest decision trees to predict the reason for attrition and compared the efficiencies
- Trained and implemented Naive Bayes' classifier to predict the reason for attrition
